click <a href='https://github.com/7zaa/IEEE-Congress-on-Evolutionary-Computation-Benchmark-functions-suite/archive/refs/heads/main.zip'>here</a> to download this repositorie.

This repositories include the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation Benchmark functions suite (IEEE CEC 2014 2017 2020 2022). You can use the untitled.m to form a figure of the benchmark function. 

The result of the code running is shown in the following picture.

I used CEC for many comparisons in many papers, you can cite my paper as follows(bibtex form):
